# 🗨️ Fluent - Secure Chat App with End-to-End Encryption

**Fluent** is a secure, real-time Android chat application built with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. It features **end-to-end encrypted messaging**, **token-based authentication**, and **real-time communication** using **Ktor WebSockets** — all backed by a **FastAPI** server.

## 🔐 End-to-End Encryption Details

Each device generates an RSA keypair securely stored via the **Android Keystore System**.
- Messages are encrypted with the **recipient's public key**.
- Messages are decrypted using the **user’s private key** on-device.
- No plaintext is stored or transmitted at any point.
- Message decryption runs on a **dedicated coroutine scope** with `SupervisorJob` and `Mutex` for serialized, thread-safe access.

---

## 🧪 Real-Time Communication

- Messages are received over WebSocket (`Ktor client`)
- Decryption occurs on a background coroutine (`Dispatchers.Default`) using a `Mutex`
- Flow collector emits to the UI using `SharedFlow` to support real-time updates

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🧬 **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose**
- 🌐 **Ktor HTTP/WebSocket Client**
- 🧩 **Koin** (DI)
- 🛡️ **EncryptedSharedPreferences**
- 🔐 **Android Keystore (RSA)**
- 🧠 **StateFlow + SharedFlow**
- 🖥️ **FastAPI (Python Backend)**
- 📜 **JWT Authentication (Access + Refresh Tokens)**

---

## 🧱 Improvements Made

- ✅ RSA decryption now safely runs in a background coroutine with a `Mutex` to avoid `IllegalBlockSizeException`
- ✅ Decryption bug fixed: messages now decrypt properly when received live (even without screen navigation)
- ✅ `SupervisorJob` added to isolate failure of decrypt jobs
- ✅ Scoped coroutine (`wsScope`) handles WebSocket lifecycle reliably
- ✅ WebSocket reconnect and lifecycle cleanup improved

---

## 🚧 Future Work

- [x] User Search API integration
- [x] Real-Time Message Sync using Flow
- [ ] Push Notifications (FCM integration)
- [ ] Typing Indicators
- [ ] Media Sharing (images, files, voice notes)
- [ ] Offline-first with Room DB
- [ ] Read receipts, chat status
